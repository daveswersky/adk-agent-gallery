Of course. This sounds like an excellent opportunity. Given your previous work on an ADK sample gallery, you're in a great position to create some compelling demos. Let's craft a few ideas that tie the Agent Development Kit, RAG, and the Gemini CLI into a cohesive narrative relevant to Kinaxis and their supply chain management domain.

The core idea is to frame the demos around a single, relatable business problem: **resolving a supply chain disruption.**

### The Overarching Narrative: "The Proactive Supply Chain Analyst Agent"

You can present a story where an AI agent acts as a co-pilot for a human supply chain analyst, proactively identifying a problem, researching solutions, and providing actionable recommendations.

### Demo 1: The Agent Development Kit (ADK) - Proactive Disruption Resolution

This demo showcases the agent's ability to perform complex, multi-step tasks. You can call the agent **"RapidResolve Agent"** to echo Kinaxis's "RapidResponse" platform.

**Scenario:** An agent is monitoring global logistics news and internal inventory data. It detects a critical disruption.

**Demo Flow:**

1.  **Trigger:** Start by showing a simulated alert. This could be a news headline like "Typhoon shuts down Port of Shanghai" or an internal alert like "Supplier ABC signals 15-day production delay."
2.  **Analysis (The Agent's "Thought" Process):** Use the ADK's logging or a simple UI to show the agent's plan:
    * **Tool 1: Impact Assessment.** The agent calls a (mock) internal API or queries a database to identify all products and customer orders impacted by the Shanghai port closure or Supplier ABC's delay. It lists out SKUs, order numbers, and potential revenue at risk.
    * **Tool 2: Solution Research (The RAG component).** The agent knows it needs to find alternative solutions. It activates a RAG tool to query the corporate knowledge base. *This is the perfect segue to the next demo.*
    * **Tool 3: Recommendation Generation.** Based on the RAG results, the agent formulates a few concrete options (e.g., "Re-route via Port of Ningbo," "Source from alternate Supplier XYZ," "Use air freight for high-priority orders").
3.  **Output:** The agent presents a clear, concise summary in a human-readable format (e.g., Markdown, email draft) that includes:
    * **Problem:** Port of Shanghai closed.
    * **Impact:** $2.5M in orders for Products X, Y, Z are affected.
    * **Recommendation 1:** Re-route via Ningbo. Cost: +$50k. Delay: +3 days. *Source: "Contingency Playbook Q3-2025.pdf"*
    * **Recommendation 2:** Use alternate Supplier XYZ. Cost: +$120k. Delay: +1 day. *Source: "Supplier Contracts & SLAs.docx"*

This demo highlights the ADK's power to orchestrate multiple tools and reason through a business problem from start to finish.

### Demo 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - The Corporate Brain

This demo dives into *how* the agent found its reliable information, showcasing the power of RAG to ground responses in proprietary company data.

**Scenario:** The human analyst wants to double-check the agent's work or explore the options it presented.

**Knowledge Base Documents (you can create small, sample text files for this):**

* `Contingency_Playbook.pdf`: A document outlining standard procedures for common disruptions.
* `Supplier_Contracts.docx`: A file with details about primary and secondary suppliers, including their capacity and lead times.
* `Historical_Shipment_Data.csv`: A spreadsheet of past shipment times from various ports.

**Demo Flow:**

1.  **The "Ungrounded" Question:** First, ask a standard Gemini model (without RAG): *"What is our standard procedure if the Port of Shanghai closes?"* It will likely give a generic, unhelpful answer or state that it doesn't have access to that information.
2.  **The RAG-Powered Question:** Now, ask the same question using your RAG implementation pointing to the knowledge base: *"What is our standard procedure if the Port of Shanghai closes?"*
3.  **The Grounded Answer:** Gemini will now provide a precise answer, pulling directly from your `Contingency_Playbook.pdf`. The key is to show the response **and the source document(s)** it used. You can phrase the answer like:
    > "According to the Contingency Playbook (Contingency_Playbook.pdf, page 4), the primary alternative is to re-route shipments through the Port of Ningbo. This typically adds 2-4 days to the lead time. For high-priority shipments, air freight is pre-approved if the value exceeds $500k."

This powerfully demonstrates how RAG prevents hallucinations and provides trustworthy, auditable answersâ€”a critical feature for enterprise use.

### Demo 3: The Gemini CLI - The Analyst's Power Tool

This demo is for the more technical folks in the audience, showing how they can integrate Gemini into their daily command-line workflows for quick analysis and scripting.

**Scenario:** The analyst needs to do some quick, ad-hoc data exploration related to the disruption that the high-level agent hasn't already done.

**Demo Flow:**

1.  **Quick Data Analysis:**
    * Show a messy CSV file (`inventory_data.csv`).
    * Use a shell pipeline to feed it into the Gemini CLI.
    * **Prompt:** `cat inventory_data.csv | gemini-cli "This is our current inventory for the affected SKUs. Which product has the lowest days of supply on hand? Present the answer as a JSON object."`
    * This shows how quickly a user can get a structured answer from unstructured text without opening a spreadsheet.

2.  **On-the-Fly Scripting:**
    * Show how the CLI can accelerate tasks that involve interacting with systems.
    * **Prompt:** `gemini-cli "Write a bash script that uses curl to call our inventory API endpoint 'api.kinaxis-demo.com/inventory/{sku}' for SKUs 8675, 309, and 5309 and checks if the 'stock_level' is below 50."`
    * This demonstrates how Gemini can be a powerful co-pilot for technical users, automating small but tedious tasks.

### Kinaxis-Specific Talking Points to Weave In:

* **Concurrent Planning:** Mention how these AI tools can feed real-time insights into their concurrent planning engine, allowing for even faster "what-if" scenario analysis.
* **Resilience and Agility:** Frame the whole demo narrative around improving supply chain resilience and business agility in the face of volatility.
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** Emphasize that these tools aren't replacing the supply chain planner but are acting as a powerful "co-pilot" to augment their expertise and allow them to focus on strategic decision-making rather than manual data gathering.

By linking these three demos into a single, relevant story, you'll provide a much more impactful and memorable presentation for the Kinaxis team. Good luck!
