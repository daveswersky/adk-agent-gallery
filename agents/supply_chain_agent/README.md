# Supply Chain Agent

The **RapidResolve Agent** is a proactive supply chain co-pilot that orchestrates specialist sub-agents to comprehensively respond to supply chain disruption alerts.

When it receives a disruption alert, it performs the following steps:
1.  **Impact Analysis:** It first assesses the scope of the problem, identifying affected orders and calculating the total revenue at risk.
2.  **Solution Research:** It then researches mitigation strategies from an internal corporate knowledge base using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
3.  **Synthesis:** Finally, it synthesizes all the information into a single, clear, actionable recommendation for the user.
